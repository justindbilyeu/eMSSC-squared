# Contributing to eMSSC²

Welcome to the **Exponential Microbial Systems for Sustainable Communities (eMSSC²)** project!  
We’re building **zero-electric, regenerative water–energy–soil systems**.  

## 🚀 How to Contribute
1. **Fork & Clone**: Fork the repo and create a branch.  
2. **Choose a Task**:
   - **Simulations** → add models to `05-technical-resources/simulations/`.  
   - **Hardware** → propose TriSource designs in `02-integrated-systems/`.  
   - **Pilots** → suggest sites or plans in `03-deployment-framework/`.  
3. **Submit a PR**: Use clear commit messages and link related files.  
4. **Join Discussions**: Post questions, ideas, or feedback in GitHub Discussions.  

## 🧩 Style & Conventions
- **Code**: Python ≥3.10, PEP8.  
- **CSV**: UTF-8, snake_case headers, ISO-8601 timestamps.  
- **Figures**: Prefer SVG with one accent color (#0B84F3) and orange (#FF7F0E for brine).  
- **Docs**: Keep short, reference file paths, and link related resources.  

## 🤖 AI Collaborators
We use AI tools (Claude, DeepSeek, Grok, ChatGPT) as **on-demand reviewers**.  
When asking for help, always include:  
- File path(s)  
- Task goal & constraints  
- Related links  

**Example Prompt:**  
> Review `02-integrated-systems/TriSource/INTERFACES.md` for clarity. Ensure it aligns with `05-technical-resources/metrics/KPIs.md` and schematic `05-technical-resources/figures/system_diagram.md`. Suggest concise edits.  

## 🌍 Community
- **Issues** → bugs, ideas, or feature requests  
- **Discussions** → brainstorming, Q&A, experiments  
- **Code of Conduct** → see `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`  

Thank you for building regenerative infrastructure with us!
