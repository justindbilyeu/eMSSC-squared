# Condensation & Fouling Mitigation (Notes)
- **Vapor seals**: high-temp silicone gaskets at stage interfaces.
- **Condensate path**: dedicated drainage channels per stage with 2–3° slope.
- **Anti-fouling**: hydrophilic coatings or periodic flush; easy-clean access ports.
- **Materials**: verify LSMO/substrate compatibility (thermal expansion); use compliant mounts.
- **Sensors**: add condensate tray level sensor for early overflow detection.
