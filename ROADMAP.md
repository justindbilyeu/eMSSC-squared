# eMSSC² Roadmap

This roadmap aligns the development of the TriSource Water Node™ and SunShare HomeNode™ programs. It is updated as milestones are achieved and new partnerships form. Contribute revisions via pull request.

## Program Snapshot (Q3 2025)

| Program | Core Purpose | Current Assets | Immediate Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **TriSource Water Node™** | Solar-integrated AWH + MSSC + desalination node for community-scale deployment | v1.1 white paper, component research packets, energy models, desal evidence sprints | Bench-scale demonstrator (≥5 L/day) with telemetry and remote logging |
| **SunShare HomeNode™** | Residential PV, greywater treatment, and AI-enabled control | Site brief, HomeNode simulations, bill of materials (in progress) | Build-ready wiring diagram + software image for rapid install |

## 90-Day Execution Map

| Day Range | TriSource Focus | HomeNode Focus | Success Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1–30** | Finalize component validation packages (`docs/02-integrated-systems/component-specs/`) | Translate HomeNode simulations into installation schematics | Reorganized repository + ready-to-share documentation set |
| **31–60** | Build thermal and hydraulic bench tests; capture data for appendix updates | Procure hardware and pilot a micro-scale installation | Demonstrator data feeding `TriSource-Appendix.md` |
| **61–90** | Prepare investor diligence packet using `docs/04-business-development/` collateral | Launch community pilot candidate outreach with `ProjectRadar.csv` | Signed pilot LOIs + deployment plan |

## Workstreams & Owners

1. **Documentation & Narrative** – Maintain canonical sources in `docs/02-integrated-systems/technical-papers/` and synchronize supporting assets (`VERSIONS.md`).
2. **Engineering Validation** – Track open questions inside `docs/02-integrated-systems/performance-modeling/`; attach new simulations under `docs/05-technical-resources/simulations/`.
3. **Funding & Partnerships** – Update grant intelligence (`docs/04-business-development/funding-grants/`) and keep the pitch suite current.
4. **Deployment Prep** – Coordinate permitting and site-readiness via `docs/06-pilot-implementations/installation-guides/` and the project radar.

## Upcoming Deliverables

- **Q3 2025:** Bench data integrated into the TriSource appendix and economic narrative refresh.
- **Q4 2025:** Pilot site selection finalized; installation checklist expanded with wiring diagrams.
- **Q1 2026:** First case study documented in `docs/06-pilot-implementations/case-studies/`.
