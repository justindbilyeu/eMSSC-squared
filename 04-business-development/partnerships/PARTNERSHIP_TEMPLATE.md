## Specific Technical Contributions from eMSSC²
1. **Brine / Byproduct Valorization**  
   - <Wetlands/halophytes/mineral recovery/soil loops.>
2. **Water Quality & Safety**  
   - <MSSC sensor stack (DO/ORP/pH/EC/T), UV-C/micro-dosing, logging.>
3. **Field Deployment Platforms**  
   - <Active testbeds, TriSource plumbing, open hardware BOMs.>

## Joint Development Opportunities & Shared IP Potential
- **Module Co-Development**: <How we integrate their core tech into TriSource cartridges/condensers.>  
- **Nature+Tech Integration**: <MSSC wetland/bioreactor coupling.>  
- **Shared IP Pathways**: <Derivative designs, processes; open/closed strategy.>

---

## Collaboration Timeline
- **0–3 months**:  
  - <PoC builds, preliminary field data, QA envelope.>
- **3–6 months**:  
  - <Partner-supplied materials integration; field trials.>
- **6–12 months**:  
  - <Pilot array with daily L target; publication + co-IP drafting.>

---

## Funding & Publication Synergies
