# Partnership Brief ‚Äî UNIST √ó eMSSC¬≤ (SunShare / TriSource / MSSC)

**Date:** September 2025  
**Prepared by:** eMSSC¬≤ Collective (SunShare Initiative, TriSource Node‚Ñ¢, MSSC)

## Executive Summary
UNIST‚Äôs breakthrough in **La‚ÇÄ.‚ÇáSr‚ÇÄ.‚ÇÉMnO‚ÇÉ (LSMO) inverse-L evaporators** achieves record solar-driven desalination (3.4 L¬∑m‚Åª¬≤¬∑h‚Åª¬π under 1 sun, electricity-free). eMSSC¬≤ extends this innovation from laboratory scale to **deployable community systems** through the **TriSource Node‚Ñ¢** and **Microbial Sump-to-Soil Cultivator (MSSC)**. Our integration turns desalination into a **closed-loop regenerative water-soil system**, directly aligned with humanitarian, agricultural, and resilience deployments.

Together, we can demonstrate the world‚Äôs first **zero-electric solar desalination + microbial valorization platform**, scaling from pilot farms to villages and schools.

## Specific Technical Contributions from eMSSC¬≤
1. **Brine & Salt Valorization**
   - Constructed wetlands + halophyte systems for polishing concentrate.  
   - Solid salt capture & mineral recovery tied to soil/carbon projects.  
   - Integration with MSSC ponds/bogs for microbial upcycling.  

2. **Water Quality & Safety**
   - Proven MSSC sensor stack (DO/ORP/pH/EC/temp) for inline QA.  
   - Options for UV-C or micro-dosing disinfection before potable use.  
   - Logging frameworks for field validation and regulatory reporting.  

3. **Field Deployment Platforms**
   - Active **farm-scale testbeds** (Texas flower farm + duck pond bog).  
   - TriSource plumbing already configured for hybrid AWG + solar desal modules.  
   - Open hardware BOMs for rapid 0.5‚Äì1 m¬≤ proof-of-concept builds.
