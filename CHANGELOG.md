## [2025-09-22] Repository Reorganization

- Established a documentation-first folder hierarchy under `docs/` aligned with the eMSSCÂ² framework.
- Migrated ~60 legacy files into logical audience-focused directories and archived superseded versions.
- Authored README guides for every major folder plus subdirectories to improve navigation.
- Introduced repository-wide navigation aids (`INDEX.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `VERSIONS.md`) and summarized legacy assets in `archive/`.
