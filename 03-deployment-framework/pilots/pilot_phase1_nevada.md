# Pilot Phase 1 — Nevada (Draft)

## Objective
Demonstrate a small TriSource + MSSC + SPMD array for an arid U.S. agricultural site.

## Targets
- Water: 100 L/day  
- Energy (aux): <7 kWh/day  
- Soil: Halophyte test bed, track EC and OM%  

## Layout
- SPMD collector area: 7–8 m² (derated field performance)  
- MSSC: pond → bog → irrigation trench  
- QA: EC/T sensors, UV unit, remineralization  

## Metrics
- Flux, daily liters, kWh/L, TDS reduction  
- Soil EC (dS/m), OM (%)  
- Log data via `05-technical-resources/experiments/data/log_template.csv`  

## Timeline
1. Site selection & partner alignment (2–4 weeks)  
2. PoC module assembly (4–6 weeks)  
3. Install & train (1–2 weeks)  
4. Monitor 60–90 days, push logs to repo  

## Partners
- Local farm or ag co-op  
- University QC lab (water/soil)  
- NGO/ESG sponsor for deployment
