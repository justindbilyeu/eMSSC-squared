# Derated Assumptions (Field)
- Lab flux: 3.4 L/m²/h → **Field**: 1.4–1.7 L/m²/h (multi-stage effective)
- Sun hours: 5–6 effective hours/day
- Area: 5–6 m² for 50–60 L/day
- Aux energy: < 9 kWh/day with duty-cycling
- GOR target: 2.5–3.0

| Parameter        | Conservative | Likely | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Field flux (L/m²/h) | 1.4 | 1.7 | 3–4 stages, 0.85 stage eff |
| Daily L @ 6 m²      | 46  | 56  | 5.5 sun h |
| Aux kWh/day         | 8.0 | 9.0 | Optimized duty cycles |
| GOR                 | 2.3 | 2.8 | Improve via HX efficiency |
