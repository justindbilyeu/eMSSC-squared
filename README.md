# eMSSC¬≤ ‚Äî Exponential Microbial Systems for Sustainable Communities

**Vision:** Zero-electric, regenerative water-energy-soil systems integrating MSSC, TriSource, and UNIST LSMO solar desalination.

We orchestrate microbial electrochemical bioreactors, TriSource hybrid nodes, and photothermal desalination modules into a deployable platform for climate-stressed communities. The program aligns engineering, policy, and capital pathways so DOE/USAID reviewers, UNIST collaborators, and ESG funders can accelerate field-ready infrastructure that regenerates water, energy, and soil without grid dependencies.

## üöÄ Join the eMSSC¬≤ Revolution

## ‚ö° Quick Start
- Run a sizing sim: `python 05-technical-resources/simulations/spmd_sizing.py`
- Try the MSSC toy model: `python 05-technical-resources/simulations/mssc_growth.py`
- Add a part to the BOM: edit `05-technical-resources/boms/trisource_poc_bom.csv`
- Propose a pilot: edit `03-deployment-framework/pilots/pilot_phase1_arizona.md` and open a PR

### ü§ñ Use AI as a Reviewer
When you ask Claude/DeepSeek/Grok/ChatGPT for help, include:
- File paths (e.g., `02-integrated-systems/TriSource/control_logic.py`)
- Task goal & constraints
- Links to KPIs and diagrams

### üîß Run the Core Checks
```bash
python 05-technical-resources/simulations/thermal_model.py
python 05-technical-resources/simulations/spmd_sizing.py  # if present
pytest -q
```
