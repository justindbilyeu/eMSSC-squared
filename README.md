# eMSSC² — Exponential Microbial Systems for Sustainable Communities

**Mission:** eMSSC² integrates MSSC microbial bioreactors, TriSource hybrid nodes, and UNIST LSMO solar desalination technology to deliver zero-electric, regenerative water–energy–soil systems for climate-stressed communities. Together we prototype replicable infrastructure that turns microbial intelligence and solar flux into resilient services.

## Integrated Platform at a Glance
- **Closed-loop bio-hydrology.** MSSC bioreactors transform organic residues into high-value inoculants and soil amendments that drive nutrient cycling while polishing reclaimed water streams.
- **TriSource hybrid nodes.** Modular atmospheric harvesting, microbial polishing, and membrane desalination operate as a single control block, powered by dedicated PV-thermal arrays with battery optionality.
- **UNIST LSMO solar desalination.** Partnership with UNIST leverages lanthanum strontium manganese oxide (LSMO) photothermal absorbers to intensify distillation without external electrical loads.
- **Community deployment stack.** Design-for-maintenance documentation, remote telemetry, and training curricula enable rural, island, and peri-urban operators to own, iterate, and expand nodes.
