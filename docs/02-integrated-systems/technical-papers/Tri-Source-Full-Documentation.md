# 💧 Tri-Source Water Node™ — Full Documentation

A decentralized, solar-integrated water system designed for resilience in arid climates. The Tri-Source Node combines:

- **HydroLens™ Atmospheric Water Harvesting**
- **MSSC Node™ Microbial Enrichment**
- **SPMD™ Brine-Resistant Desalination**

It delivers **potable**, **non-potable**, and **nutrient-cycled water** through a solar-powered, closed-loop system optimized for modular deployment across schools, farms, and off-grid communities.

## 🧬 System Architecture

### Modular Integration:

- **HydroLens™**: Captures moisture from ambient air using solar-driven sorbents.
- **MSSC Node™**: Bioreactor that cycles greywater and runoff through a microbially enriched medium, reducing nitrate load and creating a soil amendment stream.
- **SPMD™ Desalination**: Converts saline or brackish water to freshwater via passive thermal or membrane-based desalination with brine heat recovery.

|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Water**         | AWH + greywater recycling → potable/non-potable streams                     |
| **Nutrient**      | MSSC outputs → soil amendment + microbial soil enrichment                    |
| **Energy**        | Solar thermal and PV → drives pumps, heat exchangers, and sensors           |
| **Brine**         | Sacrificial crystallization + halophyte reuse to reduce waste and salinity  |

## 🛠️ Deployment Scenarios

### 📍 Target Sites

- Arid or semi-arid rural regions
- Schools and community centers with unreliable water
- Small-scale farms needing off-grid irrigation
- Coastal or inland areas with brackish wellwater

### 🧱 Infrastructure Requirements

- 300–800W solar array
- Modular housing (cabinet or buried cistern)
- Bio-reactor chambers with replaceable media
- Brine outflow containment or halophyte wetland

## 🧪 Chemistry Insights

Brine crystallization modeling at 75°C shows:

- **CaSO₄** precipitates first (~80% volume remaining)
- **MgCO₃** nears saturation at 50%
- **NaCl / MgCl₂** remain in solution until extreme concentration

### Recommendations:

- Precipitate CaSO₄ early in a crystallization chamber
- Use halophytes and biofilms to reduce Mg²⁺ and Na⁺ load
- Avoid Ca²⁺ fouling in microbial chambers
