# Pilot Implementations & Case Work

Resources that support real-world deployments and pilots. Use these materials when preparing specific sites or documenting outcomes.

## Subdirectories

- **site-planning** – Profiles and requirements for specific site archetypes (e.g., SunShare HomeNode™).
- **installation-guides** – Checklists and procedural guides for on-the-ground teams.
- **case-studies** – Space reserved for post-deployment reporting.

Coordinate with the deployment framework and business development folders for end-to-end execution.
