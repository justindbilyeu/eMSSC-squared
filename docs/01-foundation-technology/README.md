# Foundation & Microbial Technology

This section houses the core science behind eMSSC², with a focus on microbial soil and system cycling. Use these materials to understand the biological principles that inform system design.

## Contents

- **MSSC-Node.md** – Overview of the Microbial Soil & System Cycling (MSSC) node and its role in the broader platform.
- **MSSC_research.pdf** – Collected research supporting MSSC design and microbial performance.
- **Compostandcomposttea-...pdf** – Reference paper on compost and compost tea as substrates, informing microbial strategies.

Additional foundational research can be proposed via pull requests or referenced within the bibliography in `../05-technical-resources/bibliography/`.
