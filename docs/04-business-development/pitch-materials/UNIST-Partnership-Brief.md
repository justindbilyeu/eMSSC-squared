# UNIST Partnership Brief — September 2025

## Strategic Intent
- Align eMSSC² TriSource hybrid nodes with UNIST’s Materials Science and Engineering teams advancing lanthanum strontium manganese oxide (LSMO) photothermal absorbers.
- Establish a joint validation pathway that keeps the desalination subsystem zero-electric while scaling throughput for coastal and island communities.
- Define IP boundaries so MSSC microbial innovations and UNIST materials research can co-publish while protecting provisional filings.

## Collaboration Workstreams
1. **Materials-to-system translation.** Co-develop absorber specifications, surface treatments, and condensing geometries for integration inside TriSource thermal stages.
2. **Field data loop.** Share instrumentation design, sampling cadence, and telemetry templates that feed the risk-mitigated experiment plan in `docs/05-technical-resources/experiments/`.
3. **Deployment roadmap.** Coordinate pilot site vetting with UNIST global partnership office, focusing on desalination-constrained agricultural zones.

## Governance & Next Steps
- Draft memorandum of understanding (MoU) and data-sharing agreement queued for legal review (target: October 2025).
- Quarterly technical syncs led by eMSSC² systems engineering and UNIST desalination researchers; first session scheduled for 15 October 2025.
- Joint funding submissions planned for DOE DWPR, USAID WASH, and Gates Foundation calls using shared experiment evidence.

**Primary contacts:**
- *eMSSC²:* Justin Bilyeu — `justin@sunshare.community`
- *UNIST:* Prof. TBD (Solar Desalination Lab) — `unist-partnership@unist.ac.kr`
