## ðŸ”· Executive Summary

The **Tri-Source Water Nodeâ„¢** is a modular, solar-powered system for off-grid water security and regenerative fertility. It unites three core technologies into a single, closed-loop infrastructure:

- ðŸŒ€ **HydroLensâ„¢** â€” Atmospheric Water Harvesting (AWH) via solar-regenerated desiccants  
- ðŸ§« **MSSC Nodeâ„¢** â€” Microbial greywater treatment and nutrient cycling  
- ðŸŒŠ **SPMD Unit** â€” Solar-powered Membrane Distillation or hybrid Reverse Osmosis  

Together, they harvest water from the air, reclaim greywater for irrigation and compost, and desalinate brackish or seawaterâ€”all powered by the sun, with no external chemicals, diesel inputs, or waste discharge.

**Daily Output**: ~60â€“65 liters potable and non-potable water  
**Energy Use**: <7 kWh/day total system draw  
**Power Source**: 5â€“6.5 kW solar (PV + thermal), optional 15 kWh battery  

Built for deployment in **arid**, **coastal**, and **infrastructure-fragile** regions, the Tri-Source Node delivers more than just clean water:  
it **creates fertility**, **closes resource loops**, and **returns agency** to the communities it serves.

With validated thermodynamics, early microbial data, and an evolving materials science roadmap (MOFs, MXenes, GO membranes), the Tri-Source Water Node represents a novel convergence of ecological intelligence and engineering minimalism.

It is not a device. It is a **resilience engine**.
