# eMSSC² Documentation Portal

This directory collects the complete documentation set for the eMSSC² program. Content is organized to guide readers from the scientific foundation through integrated system design, deployment, business strategy, and real-world pilots.

For a quick overview of where to find specific material, start with the [master documentation index](../INDEX.md).

## Structure

- **01-foundation-technology** – Microbial science, MSSC fundamentals, and the biological research underpinning eMSSC².
- **02-integrated-systems** – TriSource Water Node™ and related system architecture, component specifications, and performance modeling resources.
- **03-deployment-framework** – Execution roadmaps, project coordination tools, and community deployment playbooks.
- **04-business-development** – Investor and partner-facing materials, legal/IP documentation, funding strategy, and economic modeling.
- **05-technical-resources** – Supporting research, simulations, bibliographies, and technical references.
