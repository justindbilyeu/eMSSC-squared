Reference material that underpins the eMSSC² program. These assets provide evidence, data, and supplementary knowledge for the core documentation.

## Subdirectories

- **simulations** – Models and calculation notebooks supporting system sizing.
- **bibliography** – Citations, references, and BibTeX sources.
