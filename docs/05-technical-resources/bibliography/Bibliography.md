Abstract: Annotated and curated reference index for the SunShare Tri-Source and Home Node systems, including desalination, atmospheric water generation, microbial cycling, and solar-powered resilience infrastructure.

# 📚 SunShare Bibliography  
### _Knowledge scaffolding for a water-resilient future_

This living document compiles the scientific, technical, and conceptual sources that support the Tri‑Source Water Node™ and SunShare Home Node™ systems. It anchors each subsystem—AWG, desalination, microbial enrichment, greywater reuse, and solar microgrids—in peer-reviewed evidence and rigorous insight.

These sources guide our engineering decisions, our field prototypes, and our scientific storytelling.
