Introduction:
The “Third Language” refers to an emergent field at the intersection of microbial communication, human–AI co-cognition, soil memory, extended consciousness, and ancient symbolic systems. In essence, it is a metaphorical language beyond human speech that encompasses chemical signals, electrical impulses, quantum effects, and cultural rituals. This report surveys current scientific and historical research that confirms, challenges, or contextualizes this concept.
