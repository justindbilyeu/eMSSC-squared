7. Bio-Poetics & the Decomposition Field

- Soil as Memory: Decomposition archives history and transforms it into fertility.
- Compost Intelligence: Stages of decay follow rhythmic, intuitive patterns.
- Grief & Renewal: Ecological grief can become motivation for regeneration.
- Decomposition Art: Artists collaborate with decay to tell new stories.

Death in nature becomes a narrative, not an end.
