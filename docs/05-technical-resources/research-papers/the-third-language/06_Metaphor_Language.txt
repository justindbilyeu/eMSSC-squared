5. Language, Metaphor, and Nonlinear Communication

- Glossolalia: Nonlinear, trance-based vocalization conveying emotional/spiritual meaning.
- Neurodivergence: Autistic individuals show unique patterns in metaphor use and literal thinking.
- Vibration as Meaning: Plants and genes respond to sound and rhythm.
- Metaphor: The core bridge for understanding nonlinear or non-human communication.

Language is more than wordsâ€”it's symbolic, vibrational, embodied.
