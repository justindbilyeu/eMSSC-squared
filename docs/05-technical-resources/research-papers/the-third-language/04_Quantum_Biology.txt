3. Quantum Biology & Field-Based Consciousness

- Quantum Coherence: Seen in photosynthesis, bird navigation, and possibly microtubules in the brain.
- Orch OR Theory: Consciousness may arise from quantum vibrations in neuronal microtubules.
- Bioelectric Fields: Plants and fungi transmit signals electricallyâ€”primitive awareness or information fields.
- Schumann Resonance: Earth's EM frequencies may synchronize with human brainwaves and heart rhythms.

These ideas imply life may communicate through physical fields as well as chemistry.
