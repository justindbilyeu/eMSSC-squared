# Research Papers & Literature

Collections of research that inform eMSSC² design decisions. Materials are grouped by theme when multiple files contribute to a single body of work.

Current bundles:

- **the-third-language/** – Interdisciplinary exploration of microbial communication, cognition, and symbolic systems supporting the program's conceptual framing.

Add new folders when additional thematic research sets are curated.
