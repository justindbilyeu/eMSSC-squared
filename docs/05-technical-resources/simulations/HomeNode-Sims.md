# 🌞 SunShare HomeNode™ – Research & Simulation Directive

Welcome, GGCDs and aligned researchers. We are now initiating Phase 2 of the HomeNode™ project: rigorous research, simulation, and prototyping.

SunShare HomeNode™ is a modular, solar-powered system for U.S. residential homes integrating:

- Water Softening
- Greywater microbial cycling (MSSC-inspired)
- AI-based water/energy balancing
- Atmospheric Water Harvesting (AWG, optional)
- Solar preheat & thermal recovery (including brine heat loops)

---

## 🧪 Objectives

### 1. **Nitrate & Salt Loop Simulation**
Model nitrate removal via microbial denitrification at residential scale:
- Input nitrate concentrations: 5–50 mg/L (EPA MCL is 10 mg/L)
- Reactor conditions: anaerobic, 20–30°C, carbon source buffered
- Output: daily removal (g/day), byproduct profiles (NO₂⁻, N₂O, N₂)
- Simulate halotolerant microbial consortia in presence of 1–3% NaCl

Also:
- Model brine heat recovery (NaCl ~3 mol/L @ 30–50°C)
- Estimate energy recovered per L of brine
- Determine thermal exchange efficiency for 1–4 person households

---

### 2. **AWG Viability for Humid vs Arid Zones**
- Use seasonal psychrometric models to simulate AWG yield at:
  - RH: 25%, 45%, 65%, 85%
  - Temp: 15°C, 25°C, 35°C
- Sorbent efficiency: LiCl, Silica Gel, MOFs (MOF-801, 841)
- Thermal load vs PV availability (4–6kWh/day budget)

---

### 3. **AI Load Balancing Architecture**
- Design AI logic flow for:
  - Optimizing when to run pumps, softener regen, AWG
  - Predicting peak water/energy demand
  - Minimizing grid draw during TOU (time of use pricing)
  - Optional: communication with smart appliances

Recommend:
- Edge vs cloud hybrid decision tree
- Model predictive control (MPC) vs fuzzy logic vs neural nets

---

### 4. **Cabinet Architecture CAD & BOM Design**
Create a compact, modular layout:
- Target footprint: <15 ft²
- Stackable tanks (Potable, Greywater, Thermal)
- Compartments: softener, MSSC biofilter, nitrate reactor, heat exchanger
- Design notes:
  - Easy homeowner maintenance
  - Code-compliant drainage access
  - Optional passive radiator for brine or solar overflow

---

### 5. **IP Risk Mapping + Innovation Clarification**
Using the prior art summary:
- Identify freedom-to-operate gaps vs SolarWall, Aqua2E, SunDrum
- Flag novelty in:
  - Brine thermal recovery + softener loop reuse
  - MSSC + halotolerant biofilm stack for NO₃⁻ + COD
  - AI-integrated household fluid + energy balance
- Document timestamped integration strategy (for IP registry)

---

### 6. **Pilot Strategy & Market Readiness**
- Recommend 3 ideal pilot sites (geography, climate, homeowner profile)
- Identify ideal system variants for:
  - Well water vs city water
  - Single-family home vs duplex
  - Low-income subsidy-eligible zones
- Compare LCOW (Levelized Cost of Water) vs bottled, salt-based softeners, and other rain/greywater reuse systems

### 🔁 Feedback Integration Plan
Please provide your response as:
- A PDF or Markdown package (with diagrams)
- Clearly labeled output per section above
- Model assumptions, constraints, and known unknowns

This will guide the field test package and HomeNode v2.0 build.
