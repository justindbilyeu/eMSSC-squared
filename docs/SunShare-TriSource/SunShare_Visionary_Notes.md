# Visionary Notes from the Founder

I saw the rooftops after the stormâ€”and knew there had to be a better way.

People suffer while energy floats overhead, untapped. SunShare was born from that moment.

This is about **resilience**, **dignity**, and a smarter grid built from the rooftops up.

This is not just a business. It's a framework for empowerment.
