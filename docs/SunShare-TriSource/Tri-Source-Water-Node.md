# ðŸ’§ Tri-Source Water Nodeâ„¢

> A decentralized, solar-integrated system combining Atmospheric Water Harvesting, microbial treatment, and brine-resistant desalination â€” engineered for resilience in arid climates.

### System Components:
- **HydroLensâ„¢** Atmospheric Water Generator  
- **MSSC Nodeâ„¢** (Microbial Enrichment Reactor)  
- **SPMD Desalination** (Solar-Powered Membrane Distillation or Hybrid RO)  

### Key Innovations:
- Closed-loop microbial cycling and thermal reuse  
- Modular deployment for farms, schools, and remote villages  
- Solar-driven resilience for potable, non-potable, and irrigation water
