## Abstract

The Tri-Source Water Node™ is a modular, solar-powered system that integrates three regenerative technologies: atmospheric water harvesting (HydroLens™), microbial water treatment and fertility cycling (MSSC Node™), and solar-powered desalination (SPMD). Designed for deployment in arid, coastal, and off-grid regions, the system forms a closed-loop infrastructure for water generation, reuse, and nutrient recovery. Leveraging low-grade solar heat, microbial energy, and passive fluid dynamics, it delivers clean water while enriching soils—without relying on external chemicals or fossil fuels.

This paper consolidates design models, peer-reviewed research, energy flow simulations, and field-validated data to evaluate the technical feasibility, economic viability, and deployment potential of the Tri-Source Water Node. Daily output ranges from 60–65 liters of usable water with less than 7 kWh/day of energy use. The system supports zero-liquid discharge, modular scaling, and compost-based fertility outputs.

Through systems integration and feedback loop design, this solution seeks to establish a new paradigm in regenerative infrastructure—where water, energy, and nutrient cycles converge to support resilient human and ecological communities. This document serves as the foundation for field pilots, investment partnerships, and global deployment in areas most vulnerable to water scarcity and climate disruption.

## 1. Introduction

Water scarcity, soil degradation, and unreliable energy access are increasingly interconnected threats—especially in rural, arid, and coastal regions. Traditional water systems rely heavily on centralized infrastructure, fossil fuel inputs, or chemically intensive treatment methods. These models are brittle, costly, and incompatible with the goals of sustainable and decentralized development.

To address these challenges, the Tri-Source Water Node proposes a modular approach: combine multiple water sources, integrate solar-powered processing, and close the loop between human use and ecological regeneration. The system merges three proven but often siloed technologies:

- **HydroLens™** – atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) using solar-regenerated sorbents  
- **MSSC Node™** – microbial bioreactors that treat greywater and generate biofertility  
- **SPMD Desalination** – solar-driven membrane distillation and/or low-energy RO

---

## 2. System Overview

The Tri-Source Water Node is designed as a closed-loop, solar-powered infrastructure system composed of three synergistic modules:

1. **HydroLens™ (Atmospheric Water Generator)**  
   Uses sorption-based materials (e.g., LiCl-impregnated silica gel) to extract moisture from the air. Solar thermal energy regenerates the sorbent, releasing vapor which is condensed into water.

2. **MSSC Node™ (Microbial Fertility Reactor)**  
   Processes greywater or runoff via microbial biofilters and microbial desalination cells (MDCs), producing irrigation water and compost.

3. **SPMD Desalination Unit**  
   Converts brackish/saline water into potable using solar membrane distillation or hybrid RO.
