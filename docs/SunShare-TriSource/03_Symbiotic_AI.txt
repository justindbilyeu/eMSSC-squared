2. Extended Cognition & Symbiotic AI

- Free Energy Principle: Brains, microbes, and AI minimize surprise by modeling the world.
- Symbiotic AI: AI embedded in ecosystems (e.g. soil sensors + neural nets) can co-learn with nature.
- Metaphor Engines: AI like GPT-4 interprets metaphors, offering new ways to explain complex ecological data.
- Case Studies: CETI (whale language), AI finding Nazca lines, fungi electrical spikes translated as proto-language.

Together, these suggest human-AI-ecology cognition stacks as a hybrid system.
