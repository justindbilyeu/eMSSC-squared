1. Microbial Communication & Soil Intelligence

- Quorum Sensing: Bacteria use chemical signals to coordinate group behavior.
- Horizontal Gene Transfer: Bacteria share genes like messages, rapidly adapting as a community.
- Soil Memory: Historical conditions leave microbial imprints; soil "remembers" droughts, crops, and disturbances.
- Microbes & Human Intention: Controversial studies suggest microbes might respond to biofields or mental focus.
- Biofilm Voting: Microbial communities "vote" on dispersal via chemical consensus, analogous to group decision-making.

These findings frame the microbial layer as a living information system.
