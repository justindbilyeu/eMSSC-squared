# Energy Production and Financial Model

Each 400W solar panel can generate ~580 kWh/year in Texas conditions.

- 100 panels = ~58,000 kWh/year
- At $0.14/kWh average sale price → $8,120 gross revenue/year
- ITC & USDA grants reduce install costs
- Payback period: ~5–7 years
- After that: net profit with low maintenance

**Plus**:
- Grid relief (quantifiable social benefit)
- Resilience credits & potential carbon monetization
