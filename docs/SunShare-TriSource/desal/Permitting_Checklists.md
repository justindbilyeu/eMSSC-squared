# Permitting & Compliance Checklists — Desalination (v0.1)

> **Purpose:** Quick-reference checklists for U.S. inland brackish (Texas) and coastal (California) desal projects. *Not legal advice.*

## Inland Brackish (Texas) — Checklist
- [ ] Define project type: municipal vs. private; capacity (m³/d).
- [ ] Source water right & well permitting (TCEQ/TWDB as applicable).
- [ ] Concentrate (brine/ROC) management plan:
  - [ ] Option: deep well injection (UIC Class I/II where applicable)
  - [ ] Option: evaporation pond (siting, liners, hydrology)
  - [ ] Option: MLD/ZLD (crystallizer; waste handling)
  - [ ] Option: nature-based pilot (constructed wetland/halophyte plot) — **research only** until approved.
- [ ] Pretreatment residuals management (screenings, backwash, sludge).
- [ ] Discharge permits (if any surface discharge) — mixing zone / WQ standards.
- [ ] Concentrate hauling (if offsite) — transporter permits.
- [ ] Environmental review (NEPA if federal funds; state/local if not).
- [ ] Public notice/engagement plan.
- [ ] Monitoring plan (SEC, recovery, TDS, metals, organics; brine tracking).
- [ ] Safety & Ops: chemical storage, secondary containment, SPCC if required.

## Coastal Seawater (California) — Checklist
- [ ] Intake design (screen/marine impacts; subsurface intake where feasible).
- [ ] Discharge mixing zone modeling; diffuser design; NPDES permit.
- [ ] Brine toxicity testing (bioassays) and monitoring plan.
- [ ] Coastal Commission review and CEQA.
- [ ] Energy use & GHG reporting; renewable PPAs where required.
- [ ] Marine protected areas proximity analysis; entrainment/impingement mitigation.
- [ ] Community benefits & alternatives analysis.
- [ ] Construction staging & traffic plans; cultural & tribal consultation.

## Documentation to Attach
- Process Flow Diagram (PFD) + P&ID
- Mass/Energy balance and specific energy (kWh/m³) calculation
- Pretreatment selection & SDI/UF specs
- Brine management narrative w/ contingency
- QA/QC plan for sampling and reporting
